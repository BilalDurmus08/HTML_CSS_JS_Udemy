    <h1>Get-rich-quick scheme</h1>
    <p>
        <nav>A get-rich-quick scheme is a plan </nav>
        <aside>something something bla bla I need just word</aside>
        to <a href="/something">obtain</a> high rates of return for a small investment. The term "get rich
        quick" has been used to describe shady investments since at least the early 20th century.[1][2]

        Most schemes create an impression that participants can obtain this high rate of return with little risk, and
        with little skill, effort, or time. Get-rich-quick schemes often assert that wealth can be obtained by working
        at home. Legal and quasi-legal get-rich-quick schemes are frequently advertised on infomercials and in magazines
        and newspapers. Illegal schemes or scams are often advertised through spam or cold calling. Some forms of
        advertising for these schemes market books or compact discs about getting rich quick rather than asking
        participants to invest directly in a concrete scheme.

    <h2>Online schemes</h2>
    <p>Get-rich-quick schemes that operate entirely on the Internet usually promote "secret formulas" to affiliate
        marketing and affiliate advertising. The scheme will usually claim that it does not require any special IT or
        marketing skills and will provide an unrealistic timeframe in which the individual could make hundreds of
        thousands, if not millions of dollars.</p>

        Richard Lustig, a seven-time lottery winner from the US, wrote a 2013 booklet explaining the methods to which he
        attributed his success which became a best-seller on Amazon.com.[3] Finance journalist Felix Salmon
        characterized Lustig as "a get-rich-quick" hack.[4]
