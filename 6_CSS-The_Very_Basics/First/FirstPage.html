    <p> Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, characterised by feathers,
        toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a
        strong
        yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the
        2.8
        m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are
        passerine, or
        "perching" birds</p>
