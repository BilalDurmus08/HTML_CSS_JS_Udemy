    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl,
        originally from India. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey
        Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male
        may
        be calld
        a cockerel.</p>
